# AI Tool Usage and Observations

This document records the use of AI tools during the development of this project, including what they were used for and reflections on their effectiveness.

## Usage Record

| Increment        | Tool Used                          | Purpose |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Level 2–6        | Google DeepMind Agentic AI        | Generating initial skeletal classes and basic OOP structure. |
| A-Collections    | Google DeepMind Agentic AI        | Refactoring task storage from arrays to `ArrayList`. |
| A-Enums          | Google DeepMind Agentic AI        | Refactoring constants in `AK.java` into enums. |

## Observations

### What Worked
- **Rapid prototyping**: AI significantly reduced setup time by generating boilerplate code and class structures quickly.
- **Refactoring assistance**: Structural refactors (arrays → `ArrayList`, constants → enums) were handled accurately and saved manual effort.
- **Consistency**: Generated code generally followed existing project style and conventions.

### What Didn’t Work as Well
- **Edge cases and logic validation**: AI-generated code occasionally required manual correction for edge cases and integration with existing logic.
- **Overgeneralization**: Some suggestions were broader than needed and had to be trimmed down to fit assignment constraints.

### Overall Impact
- The use of AI tools saved a noticeable amount of development time, especially during early scaffolding and refactoring stages.
- Final correctness and design decisions still required human review and adjustment.

This file will be updated periodically as AI tools continue to be used.
