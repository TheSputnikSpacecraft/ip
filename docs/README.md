# 🕵️‍♂️ Requiem (Detective Hart Edition) - User Guide

**Requiem** isn't just a chatbot; it's your partner on the force. Adopting the persona of **Detective Marty Hart** from *True Detective*, it treats every task like a case file and you as "Rust", his brilliant but troubled partner.

> *"Alright, Rust. What are we lookin' at today? Make it quick."*

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I save my data?**
> **A:** Requiem files the paperwork automatically in the `data` folder. No need to assist.
